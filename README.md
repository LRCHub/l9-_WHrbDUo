[00:10.74] That feeling that doesn't go away just did
[00:17.07] And I walked a thousand miles to prove it
[00:22.57] And I'm caught in the crossfire of my own thoughts
[00:28.08] The color of my blood is all I see on the rocks
[00:33.43] As you sail from me
[00:42.93] 
[00:38.24] Alarms will ring for eternity
[00:43.58] The waves will break every chain on me
[00:48.86] My bones will bleach
[00:52.22] My flesh will flee
[00:54.97] So help my lifeless frame to breathe
[01:12.97] 
[01:00.42] And God knows, I'm not dying but I bleed now
[01:06.26] And God knows, it's the only way to heal now
[01:11.81] With all the blood I lost with you
[01:17.37] It drowns the love I thought I knew
[01:34.87] 
[01:22.73] The lost dreams are buried in my sleep for him
[01:28.66] And this was the ecstasy of a love forgotten
[01:34.26] And I'm thrown in the gunfire of empty bullets
[01:39.91] And my blood is all I see
[01:44.19] As you steal my soul from me
[01:58.19] 
[01:49.53] Alarms will ring for eternity
[01:55.32] The waves will break every chain on me
[02:14.32] 
[02:00.57] And God knows, I'm not dying but I bleed now
[02:07.02] And God knows, it's the only way to heal now
[02:12.43] With all the blood I lost with you
[02:18.04] It drowns the love I thought I knew
[02:35.54] 
[02:56.33] And God knows, I'm not dying but I bleed now
[03:02.29] And God knows, it's the only way to heal now
[03:07.69] With all the blood I lost with you
[03:13.19] It drowns the love I thought I knew
[03:30.69] 
[03:18.76] And God knows, I'm not dying but I bleed now
[03:24.36] And God knows, it's the only way to heal now
[03:30.03] With all the blood I lost with you (I lost with you, I lost with you)
[03:35.94] It drowns the love I thought I knew (I thought I knew, I thought I)
