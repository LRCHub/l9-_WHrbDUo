I know I let you down, I never wanna, want to let you down
Know I let you down, I never wanna
The childrens I left and sketches I found
I drive through it now, I figure it out
You make me so sick but I [?]
As long as I live, you'll always be here
Your heart's on my sleeve, I promise to breathe

Blood of my blood, flesh of flesh
You only want over them cash
Only want what I can't feel
I'm still [?]

Blood of my blood, flesh of flesh
You only want over them cash
Only want what I can't feel
I'm still [?]

And I can't run away, I'd always be here
Even when I'm long gone, you and me, we're strong
In my everyday you know every way
Take care of yourself 'cause it's good for your health
You move in the stars, how lucky we are
You move in the stars, how lucky we are
And be glad that you're clean, how it feels in the pain
Because, do you breathe? 'Cause it fills you with pain

Blood of my blood, flesh of flesh
You only want over them cash
Only want what I can't feel
I'm still [?]

Blood of my blood, flesh of flesh
You only want over them cash
Only want what I can't feel
I'm still [?]
