[00:20.19] If I found myself another
[00:26.39] If I found a way
[00:32.35] To restart and to forget you
[00:38.74] And to hide away
[00:46.74] 
[00:45.41] I could run for my life
[00:48.53] I could go underground
[00:51.56] But you'll still be inside
[00:57.65] I could shout out the world
[01:00.85] I could move from this town
[01:03.80] But you're still in my blood
[01:17.80] 
[01:15.87] There are ways to keep away from
[01:22.10] Things that remind me of you
[01:28.19] There may be places I can go to
[01:34.46] To keep my mind, keep my mind off you
[01:52.96] 
[01:41.58] I could run for my life
[01:44.37] I could go underground
[01:47.32] But you'll still be inside
[01:53.72] I could shout out the world
[01:56.77] I could move from this town
[01:59.96] But you're still in my blood
[02:13.96] 
[02:03.54] When I let it all go, and we're finally through
[02:09.06] And I found someone new
[02:12.01] Will the feeling remain
[02:15.16] And the memories stay
[02:18.38] When you're still in my
[02:21.66] When you're still in my
[02:24.55] When you're still in my blood
[02:39.05] 
[02:30.94] I could run for my life
[02:34.04] I could go underground
[02:37.10] But you'll still be inside
[02:43.38] I could shout out the world
[02:46.24] I could move from this town
[02:49.49] But you're still in my blood
[02:55.73] Yeah, you're still in my blood
