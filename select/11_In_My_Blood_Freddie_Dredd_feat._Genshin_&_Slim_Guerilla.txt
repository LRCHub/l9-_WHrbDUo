Genshin, go back to hell

I feel it in my blood
Smokin' on the fucking bud
Like a flood, in the spring
Gonna make it fucking rain

I entertain, not for fame
Flying like a fuckin' flame
It ain't the same, when I bring
I just waste my life away

Can I say, never pay
Bitches in the alleyway
Find 'em dead by the bay
I'mma keep up with my day

I just seen, I just know
I just want to fucking go
You gon' get the hammer throw
All the way to Mexico

I'm so high up off a beat
I'mma tell you that it's clean
But it ain't, I'm just fucking late
Every single day
Who are you, who the fuck are you?
Fucking with the fool?
It ain't cool, that you fuckin' lose
Hanging from a noose

You a ghost in the fuckin' coast
Try to fuckin' boast
It's the most, of a thriller
I'm a mother fucking killer

It's surreal, better kneel
To the motherfuckin' God
Never fuck with my squad
Why are you actin' so hard?

Who is that? Comin' out the mist
Bloody knife up on my hip
Bustin' and cuttin' these suckas
I don't have to use my pistol grip

Thrilla mane a player creep
Cain't you see I can't go to sleep
Every time I try that shit
Them demons always haunting me
What the fuck did you just said?
Bust you in your fucking head
SG-Rilla mane, Freddie Dredd
Now your soul is dead

Creep on through the darkness
You'll see my black garden
I wish the rest, would try to test
I'll sell your hoe for bargain

Knock them hoes like dominos
One by one they all fucking fall
8ball Playaz cheeky
Know she spray painted on her wall

Say one word, I'll make her crawl
I bet she break the fucking law
You treat these hoes like Pokemon
I was tryna catch 'em all

Like my blood I see that bitch
Yeah she throw yo' ass in a ditch
Call that shit, and run that shit
Just gimme up my cash, trick

She have a nigga sayin, layin'
That he don't be murder
I had to prove my point
He ain't no mack, he don't deserve her
I nerf my hands, we get away clean
Ridin' out at full speed
Had that playa check it out
Make sure no nigga followin' me

Even though I made this tape
I still handout for all my friends
But fuck man, I'mma say this shit
'Fore 'nother mother fuckin' take
The playaz crib
