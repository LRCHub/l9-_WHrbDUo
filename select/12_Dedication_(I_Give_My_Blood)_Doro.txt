I'm sick and tired
Of hangin' on for too long
Of what they told me
When it feels so wrong, so wrong
It's gone too far
And feels like no way out
Injustice rules
And noone has a doubt

But am I really that lonely
Is noone here
Who feels the way I do
I'm getting sick of what they told me
And I just can't take it no more
For peace and freedom
I give my blood to make it right
For peace and the real things

I dedicate my lazy life

You don't give a thing
But take it all
You don't give a damn
For what it's for
Let comfort rule
It makes you sleep at night

Your conscience might wake you up
One time

Am I really that lonely
Is noone here
Who feels the way I do
I'm getting sick
Of what they told me
And I just can't take it no more
For peace and freedom
I give my blood to make it right
For peace and the real things
I dedicate my boring life
I can't go on
I can't go on
I can't go on and close my eyes
I give my blood to make it right
For peace and the real things in life
